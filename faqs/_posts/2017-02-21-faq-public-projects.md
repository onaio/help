Projects in Ona allow users to group forms that share characteristics. A project can either be public or private. See our [guide on creating a project](https://help.ona.io/guides/getting-started/#projects) to learn more. 

A key characteristic that forms share within a project are the [access permissions](https://help.ona.io/guides/getting-started/#project-permissions). Project access permissions include the setting for either public or private projects.

### Public Projects

Public projects and forms are visible and findable by anyone. Anyone can view and download data from the forms in the project, and they can be viewed on your [public profile page.](https://help.ona.io/guides/user-accounts/#edit-profile)

To view anyoneâ€™s public project, append the username to the Ona URL ona.io/<username> e.g (https://ona.io/betatester). A list of all the public projects will be displayed. This might be undesirable if you have any sensitive information that should not be accessed by anyone.

You can view whether a project is public or private when you click on it. The project will display PUBLIC or PRIVATE as shown below:

However, you can add a restriction for people who can submit data or alter the data in the forms.

When creating a form under any public project, the webform can be accessed by anyone with the link if you have not set the permissions for who can submit data. As for private forms, the webform can only be accessed by someone with the correct permission level to submit data.

Read more in this [guide](https://help.ona.io/guides/projects/) on how to change a project from public to private or vice versa.

Some of the pros of using a public project are you can have an unlimited number of public forms and projects. You also have access to Ona premium features i.e [Ona Apps](https://help.ona.io/guides/onaapps/), [webhooks](https://help.ona.io/faq/adding-a-webhook),[ ](https://help.ona.io/faq/adding-a-webhook)[filtered datasets](https://help.ona.io/faq/filtered-datasets) and [XLS Report](https://help.ona.io/faq/what-is-an-xls-report).

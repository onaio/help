### What is Ona?<a name="whatisona"></a>
Ona is a simple and powerful data platform. We help organizations collect, share and make sense of data from the field. Ona is built on Open Data Kit, an open-source set of mobile data collection tools.

<a name="whyona"></a>

### Why would I want to use Ona?
Ona is [constantly improving](https://ona.io/release-notes.html) to help you get the most accurate data for your program and translate that data into actionable information. Ona also offers Google Drive-like sharing permissions, allowing you to give only people you specify access to the data.

<a name="requirements"></a>

### What’s required to use Ona?
Since Ona is a web-based, so you can use it from any computer or smartphone. You’ll need an internet connection for setting up projects and deploying forms to mobile devices, but a data connection is not required for collecting data. We recommend [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) as your browser, though the website will work in any browser. To use ODK Collect, you’ll need a device running Android.

<a name="offline"></a>

### Can Ona be used offline with no data connection?
Yes. You only need a data connection to transfer forms to the mobile device. Once there, data is collected and stored on the device until a data connection is available or, if the data was collected using ODK Collect, until the device is connected to the computer and data is transferred using ODK Briefcase.

<a name="permissions"></a>

### Can anyone access my forms and data?
Only those you choose can access your projects and datasets. You can easily see who has access to your files in project sharing. The help page has a [guide on sharing and permissions](http://help.ona.io/guides/projects/#sharing-projects).

<a name="cost"></a>

### How much does Ona cost?
Pricing is based on account usage and other needs. If you are interested in a paid plan, please see our [plans page](http://company.ona.io/plans.html) and email us at sales@ona.io. There are also free plans for personal and organization accounts. The personal free plan allows 1 private project, 10 private forms, and 500 private form submissions per month. The organization free plan allows public projects only and 3 organization members. Additionally, we are dedicated to providing free service to the many Ona users from grassroots or volunteer organizations taking part in unfunded projects through the [Impact Grant Program](http://company.ona.io/impact-grant.html).

<a name="enterprise"></a>

### Are there enterprise-level accounts?
Yes. Enterprise users can email <sales@ona.io> to find out about custom features, advanced support options, and enterprise-level data management.

<a name="transferdata"></a>

### I have data from another service. Can I transfer the data to my Ona account?
Yes, you can migrate your data to Ona’s servers by using a tool called [ODK Briefcase](http://help.ona.io/faq/odk-briefcase/), which lets you transfer data across ODK Aggregate servers. For ODK Briefcase to work on your computer, make sure Java 6 or higher is installed. A detailed explanation on how to transfer data to your account can be found on the [ODK Briefcase FAQ](http://help.ona.io/faq/odk-briefcase/).

<a name="localdeploy"></a>

### Can I host my own version of Ona i.e. install a local deployment?
Yes, please see [https://github.com/SEL-Columbia/formhub/wiki/Installation-and-Deployment](https://github.com/SEL-Columbia/formhub/wiki/Installation-and-Deployment). In some cases we also work with clients to implement installs. Please email <sales@ona.io> with an overview of your needs.

<a name="language"></a>

### Is Ona available in other languages?
Yes, forms can be [written in multiple languages](https://help.ona.io/faq/adding-multiple-languages) and one can switch between them in both the ODK Collect Android app and in Enketo web forms.

The user interface is available in Kiswahili and German, which you can change in the Account Settings page. Support materials are not yet available in other language. We are happy to take requests on language — just email <support@ona.io>.

### <a name="what-are-onaapps"></a>What are OnaApps?

Ona Apps is a new advanced feature that allows users to connect their forms to external data tools. Currently, app integrations for Google Sheets, RapidPro, and TextIt are supported. 

The Google Sheets integration allows you to sync data directly from your form to a Sheet in your Google Drive account. Your connected Google Sheet is automatically updated whenever new form submissions are sent and when edits are made to existing form submissions. For more information on how this works, see the [Google Sheets](#google-sheets) section below.

[RapidPro](http://rapidpro.ona.io/) is an open source messaging platform that allows users to visually develop SMS and IVR messaging flows. This integration makes it possible to push form submissions in Ona to a connected RapidPro (or [TextIt](https://textit.in/)) flow. This integration works with the Ona-hosted version of RapidPro [(rapidpro.ona.io)](http://rapidpro.ona.io/) and other versions of RapidPro and TextIt. Read more in the [RapidPro](#rapidpro) section below. 

>**Note:**<br/> Ona Apps is an advanced feature and is included with some of our paid plans. Please email [sales@ona.io](mailto:sales@ona.io) if you're interested in hearing about our plan options.

### <a name="google-sheets"></a>Google Sheets

The new [Ona Apps](https://blog.ona.io/general/2016/07/10/introducing-ona-apps.html) intergration has introduced a new way of exporting data. You can now export data directly to your Google Drive and access the data in [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/).

There are **two** ways of exporting data to Google Sheets:

1. Connecting a form to Google Sheets;

2. Direct export to Google Sheets;  

#### <a name="connecting-form-to-google-sheets"></a>Connecting a form to Google Sheets

Export data to your Google Drive by connecting a form to Google Sheets. This way, data that has already been submitted to your form in Ona will be synchronized to a Google Sheet. Additionally, any incoming form submissions will automatically be pushed to the Google Sheet.

To connect a form to Google Sheets, go to the form’s **Settings page** click on the **Apps** tab;

![](/content/screenshots/ona-apps/google-sheets-apps.png)

Click on **Add New App** button to launch Ona Apps;

![](/content/screenshots/ona-apps/google-sheets-new-app.png)

From the Apps listed,  click on the **Google Sheets** icon to install it to your account;

Then, click on **Add Connection** button at the bottom left to connect the form to your Google Drive;

![](/content/screenshots/ona-apps/google-sheets-add-connection.png)

Your address bar will be marked with a **Pop-up blocked** click **Pop-ups blocked** and select to **Always show pop-ups from ona.io;**

You will be redirected to your Google Account, where you’ll be prompted to authenticate to your account by providing login details. This will allow Ona to access your Google Drive;

Finally, you’ll be  redirected back to the form’s **Settings;**

Rename the exported file in under the **Enter Google sheet name** textbox;

![](/content/screenshots/ona-apps/google-sheets-edit.png)

Select both **Send existing data** and **Keep Google sheet updated if data in Ona is edited or deleted** checkboxes and **Save**. This will ensure that your Google Sheet is automatically synchronised with any changes made to dataset

> 
**Note:**<br/>
Google account authentication is only done once, subsequent form connections will not require authentication since your Ona account is already connected to your Google account.

To access the created connection, click on the Google Sheet connection form title link under **Connections** section;

#### <a name="direct-export-to-goolge-sheets"></a>Direct Export to Google Sheets

This is a one time data export in Google Sheet format from the **form's Overview** page. Go to the **Export data** section, from the **File type** drop-down menu select **Google Sheets;**

![](/content/screenshots/ona-apps/google-sheets-direct-export.png)

Then click on **Prepare Google Sheet export** button to prepare your export;

![](/content/screenshots/ona-apps/google-sheets-prepare-export.png)

A dialog box will pop-up to prompt you to authorize Ona with your Google account, click on the link to provide authentication to your Google account as [explained above]() . Once Ona is authorized with Google Sheets, you can export your data to Google Sheets.

> 
**Note:**<br/>
* **Repeat groups data;** each repeat group will be in a different worksheet, but uniquely indexed to the appropriate parent unit of observation, similar to Excel data exports.
* **Connections are form based and not project based;** connections only apply to specific forms and not the entire project.
* Google Sheets are not yet supported on [filtered datasets](https://help.ona.io/faq/filtered-datasets)

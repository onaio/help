### Get started on a project

A **project** is the most basic element of Ona. The project contains all of the forms and data related to the project and information to aid understanding for new collaborators on the project, such as **Project description**, **Category** and **Location**. 

Projects are where you set permissions for sharing and form submissions. 

##### <a name="project-vs-form"></a>Project vs. Form

Projects allow you to put related forms together. A **form** is the set of questions into which the user is able to submit data. Forms are the starting point of collecting and viewing information from users. With Ona, you can author forms using the [XLSForm](http://xlsform.org/) syntax with different features such as skip logic and checks.

Data share settings and form submission settings both occur at the Project level. Every form and all of the data in the project inherits the same settings as the project. Therefore, related forms should go into a single project for easy access and collaboration. 

##### <a name="create-a-project"></a>Create a project

Create a **New Project**, that will contain all of the forms and data related to the project. To create a new project:

1. From the **Home** page, click the **New Project** orange button; located on the right side of your projects page;
1. **Create Project Modal** will pop up as shown in the in the image below;
1.Enter the **Project Name** e.g Mali;
1. Select the location from the **Country** dropdown e.g. Mali;
1. Select a category for the project from the **Category** dropdown e.g. Health;
1. Click on **Create Project** button;
1. Then, choose the project’s Share options;
 * First determine whether your project is **private** or **public**. Click on **Public** to make the project accessible to anyone on the internet with the project link;
 * Select **Private**, to make the project private. A **Private** project can only be viewed or contributed by you (the owner) and collaborators with access;
 * Enter collaborator's **username** that you would like to share the project with;
 * Select the permission type, from the permissions dropdown. Read more on permissions levels [here](permission-level);
 * Then, click on the **Share** button;
 * Click on the **Done** button when all colloborators have been added to the project.

##### <a name="categories"></a>Categories

These are group labels you add to project to help others identify the project and find the project if it is public.  You can add the project category when creating a project on the Create Project modal as shown in the image below:

The project category can be changed in project **Settings** page, select the category from the **Category** drop down menu;

### Managing projects

##### <a name="projects-shared-with-you"></a>Projects shared with you

When you login, into your account all the Projects shared with you are accessible on your **Home** page. A project that is shared with you will have the Owner's name tagged to it instead of your own as illustrated in the image below:

##### <a name="starring"></a>Starring

If there is a current project you are working on or there’s a project you’d like to follow, you can star a project. To **Star** a project click on the **star** icon next to the project name;

Once you **Star** a project, it will show up in the **Favorites** tab as shown in the image below:

##### <a name="finding-sorting"></a>Finding/Sorting

You can sort projects according to your preference on your home page. Projects can be sorted by [Category](#categories), Date Created, Last Submission and Project Name.

##### <a name="deleting-projects"></a>Deleting projects

You can delete a project from your account. Deleting a project completely removes all the forms and submissions associated with the project. This action is final and your project will be irrecoverable.

To delete a project:

1. Click on the **Projects Settings icon**;
1. On the project's **Basic Info** page, scroll down to the **Delete** section;
1. Click on **Delete This Project** button;
1. A **Confirm Delete** modal will pop up; 
1. Enter **Project name** to confirm deletion;
1. Then, click on **Delete** button to permanently delete the project and all of the forms and submissions associated with it.

### Collaborating with others

##### <a name="sharing-projects"></a>Sharing projects

Data share settings and form submission settings both occur at the Project level and are inherited by all forms in the project. If someone is given permission to a project where they have view permissions, they also receive view permissions for the forms. If a user receives Edit and above permissions for a project, they will be able to submit data to forms, as long as the form status is active. 

To share a project:

1. From the **Home** page click on the **Share** button;

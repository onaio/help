Projects are a new feature in Ona 2 that allows users to group forms that share characteristics, just like a folder in an operating system. A key characteristic that forms share within a project are access permissions. Access permissions include a setting for public or private:

- Public projects and forms within public projects are viewable and findable by anyone. However, only people you specifcy can alter data or submit data.
- Private projects and forms within private projects are viewable and findable only by you and people you choose.

Note on private projects: to accommodate legacy ODKCollect users, the XML representation of private forms is available at a URL that is not password protected.

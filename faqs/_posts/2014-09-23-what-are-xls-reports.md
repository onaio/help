XLS Reports are automatically updated Excel files with predefined calculations and charts using the latest data, letting you track metrics and indicators online in real-time. For the first time, Ona users can access a beautiful Excel report with custom metrics and indicators, updated with the latest data from their forms.

XLS Reports are currently available as a made-to-order solution. We work with clients to design and develop reports that are tailored to their specific needs. The technology is as flexible as Microsoft Excel and has been used for minimum viable product dashboards, rapid prototyping and finished reports. The resulting XLS Reports are accessible via the Details tab on a form's data view. If this sounds like it'd be useful to you, send us an email with the following info:

* Company/Organization name. 
* Description or example of the report you need.
* Description or CSV sample of the data you are starting from.
* How many times do you plan on accessing the report per month?

You can learn more by visitng the XLS Reports section on the [Ona Services page](https://ona.io/services.html).

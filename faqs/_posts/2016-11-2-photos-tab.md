Images uploaded with data can now be viewed in a photos gallery under the **Photos** tab. The photos tab displays all the images in one page which makes viewing images a lot easier as opposed to viewing them in each submission on the **Table** view.

The image caption shows the image’s number in the dataset and the submission it is attached to.

You can get more details about the image by double-clicking on it. The image opens on a single view which includes; the image’s number and the submission it is attached to, its submission time and the *Record ID* of the submission.

You can have multiple images attached to one submission including images within a [repeat group](http://xlsform.org/#repeats).

>**Note:** <br/>
>
* The photos tab is only enabled for forms that have image [question type](http://xlsform.org/#question-types) on the survey worksheet of the XLSForm.
<br><br>
* The below error message is returned when the photos tab is open for a form that has the image question but does not have any images in the dataset.

* The photos tab only shows a cropped and lower resolution version of the original images.
<br><br>
* To download the full size image, search for the submission in the **Table** or (**Map** single submission popup) using the Record ID then click on the image to get the full size version.

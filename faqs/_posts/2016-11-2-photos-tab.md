> November 2016: This feature is currently in beta and being improved.

The Photos tab lets you view all the photos from your form in a slideshow format. The Photos tab, highlighted below in the data view, is only enabled if the form has an image [question type](http://xlsform.org/#question-types).

The image caption shows the image’s number in the dataset and the submission it is from.

Clicking a thunbmail opens the image in an expanded view. In the larger view, the image’s number, the submission it is from, the submission's time, and the submission's record ID are shown at the bottom.

You can have multiple images attached to one submission including images within a [repeat group](http://xlsform.org/#repeats).

If your form does not have images submitted yet, the below message is shown.

* Currently in beta release, the Photos tab shows letterboxed and lower resolution versions of the original images that were submitted. To download the full size image, search for the submission in the **Table** tab or (**Map** tab single submission popup) using the Record ID or submission number. Then, click on the image link to get the full size version.

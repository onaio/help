### Account Setup

##### <a name="registration"></a>Creating an account

Ona is a web-based platform that works on any modern web browser. To sign up for an account follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](/guides/getting-started/#signing-up) guide or visit `https://ona.io/join` to get started quickly.

##### <a name="logging-in"></a>Logging in

Enter your username or email address and password to [log in](https://ona.io/login) to your Ona account. If you have forgotten your password, you can [reset your account password](/faq/forgot-password). 
 
##### <a name="edit-profile"></a>Editing your profile

Your public profile page on Ona is the profile that other web users can see if they search for you on Ona. It contains your name, username, avatar, and a list of your public projects (don’t worry, your [private projects](https://help.ona.io/faq/public-vs-private-project) remain hidden and private). 

To view your profile, click on the drop-down menu next to your profile avatar in the top right corner of your account, then click on your name.

Your profile page will look something like this:

> 
**Note:**<br/> If you are logged in, you will be able to see all of your projects in your profile page, both public and private. To see what your profile page looks like to other web users, copy the website url from your profile page, log out of Ona, then paste the website url back into the web address bar. You should now only see your public projects.

You can update the information that is in your profile page by going to the **Settings** menu option in the account drop-down menu.

On the **Edit Public Profile** tab, you can add or change your profile information and upload a picture to replace your avatar.

After you make the desired changes to your profile information, click on the **Save Changes** button at the bottom.

##### <a name="organization"></a>Creating an organization account

After creating your Ona account, you can optionally create an organization account. An organization account is different from a personal account in that it can be managed by multiple users, making it ideal for organizations that need to manage data across different teams. You can read more about this type of account in the [Organizations Guide](https://help.ona.io/guides/organizations/) and how org accounts differ from personal accounts in the [faq](https://help.ona.io/faq/org-accounts-vs-personal-accounts).

### Account Management

#### <a name="how-to-change-your-email-address"></a>How do I change the email address on my account?

It’s important to keep your email address up to date on your Ona account, as this is the primary way we communicate updates about the Ona platform with our users. If you forget your account password, you will need to access the email address listed on your account to [reset your password](/faq/forgot-password).

1. To change your account email address, navigate to your **Settings** page and click on the **Edit Account Settings** tab;
1. Scroll down to the **Change Email Address** section and type the new email address;

### Upgrading your account

##### <a name="upgrading-your-account"></a>Upgrading your account

Anyone who signs up to Ona automatically becomes a free plan user. The free plan is limited to 1 private project and 15 private forms with 500 submissions per month. If you would wish to upgrade to one of our paid plans to increase the number of private projects/forms you can visit the [upgrade page](https://ona.io/plans.html) and we will work with you to develop a pricing plan that meets your specific usage and support needs. Upgrading to a paid plan also gives you direct access to Ona's world class support team. Features like [filtered datasets](https://help.ona.io/faq/filtered-datasets), Webhooks, [XLS Reports](https://help.ona.io/faq/what-is-a-xls-report) and [Ona Apps](https://help.ona.io/guides/onaapps/) are available for paid plans. 

##### <a name="special-plans"></a>Do you offer special pricing for students or non-profits?

We introduced the **Impact Grant Program**, which provides a free account upgrade and support to students and members of grassroots or volunteer organizations who are making a difference in their communities but might have difficulty paying to upgrade their account. To learn more about the Impact Grant Program and to see if you qualify, please visit the [program page](https://ona.io/impact-grant.html).

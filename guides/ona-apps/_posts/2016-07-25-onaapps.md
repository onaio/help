### <a name="what-are-onaapps"></a>What are Ona Apps?

Ona Apps are powerful integrations that let users connect and grant data access to external apps. Currently, integrations with Google Sheets, RapidPro, and TextIt are supported. Ona Apps were released in [July 2016](https://blog.ona.io/general/2016/07/10/introducing-ona-apps.html). Below, we go over how to get started connecting Ona with [Google Sheets](#google-sheets) and [RapidPro](#rapidpro).

>**Note:**<br/> Ona Apps are included with select paid plans. Please email [sales@ona.io](mailto:sales@ona.io) if you're interested in hearing about plans.

### <a name="google-sheets"></a>Google Sheets

As an [Ona App](#what-are-onaapps), the Google Sheets integration allows you to sync data directly from your form in Ona to a spreadsheet in Google Sheets. Your connected spreadsheet is automatically updated whenever new form submissions are sent and when edits are made to existing form submissions.

There are **two** ways of exporting data to Google Sheets: 1) [Connecting a form to Google Sheets](#connecting-form-to-google-sheets), and 2) [Direct export to Google Sheets](#direct-export).

#### <a name="connecting-form-to-google-sheets"></a>1. Connecting a form to Google Sheets

You can export data to Google Sheets by creating a connection between a form and a spreadsheet. This way, data that has already been submitted to your form in Ona will be synchronized to a Google Sheet. Additionally, any incoming form submissions will automatically be pushed to the Google Sheet.

To connect a form to Google Sheets, go to the form’s **Settings** page and click on the **Apps** tab.

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/google-sheets-1.png)

Click on **Add New App** button to launch Ona Apps.

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/google-sheets-2.png)

From the Apps listed,  click on the **Google Sheets** icon to install it to your account.

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/google-sheets-3.png)

Then, click on **Add Connection** button at the bottom left to connect the form to your Google Drive.

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/google-sheets-4.png)

If you get a notification in your address bar marked **Pop-up blocked**, select to **Always show pop-ups from ona.io** and click **Done** to proceed.

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/google-sheets-5.png)

You will be redirected to your **Google Account**, where you’ll be prompted to authenticate by providing login details. This will allow Ona to send data your Google Drive.

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/google-sheets-6.png)

Finally, you’ll be redirected back to the form’s **Settings** page.

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/google-sheets-7.png)

If you wish, edit the name of the new Google spreadsheet in the **Enter Google sheet name** textbox.

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/google-sheets-8.png)

Selecting the **Send existing data** checkbox will sync existing Ona data to the spreadsheet. Selecting the **Keep Google sheet updated if data in Ona is edited or deleted** checkbox keeps your Google spreadsheet updated with changes made to dataset in Ona. Selecting both will ensure that your Google spreadsheet is synchronised to your data on Ona as you make edits and new data is submitted.

> 
**Note:**<br/>
Google account authentication is only done once, subsequent form connections will not require authentication since your Ona account is already connected to your Google account.

To access the created connection, click on the Google Sheet connection form title link under **Connections** section.

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/google-sheets-10.png)

#### <a name="direct-export"></a>2. Direct Export to Google Sheets

This is a one-time data export in Google Sheet format from the **form's Overview** page. Go to the **Export data** section, from the **File type** drop-down menu select **Google Sheets**.

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/google-sheets-11.png)

Then click on **Prepare Google Sheet export** button to prepare your export.

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/google-sheets-12.png)

A dialog box will pop-up to prompt you to authorize Ona with your Google account, click on the link to provide authentication to your Google account as [explained above](#connecting-form-to-google-sheets). Once Ona is authorized with Google Sheets, you can export data to Google Sheets.

>**Note:**<br/>
**Repeat groups data:** each repeat group will be in a different worksheet, but uniquely indexed to the appropriate parent unit of observation, similar to Excel data exports.
<br><br>
**Connections are form based and not project based:** connections only apply to specific forms and not the entire project. You're required to create a new connection for every form within your project.
<br><br>
Google Sheets are not yet supported on [filtered datasets](https://help.ona.io/faq/filtered-datasets).

### <a name="rapidpro"></a>RapidPro 

##### <a name="what-is-rapidpro"></a>What is RapidPro?

[RapidPro](http://rapidpro.ona.io/) is an open source messaging platform that allows users to visually develop SMS and IVR messaging flows. As an [Ona App](#what-are-onaapps), this integration makes it possible to push form submissions in Ona to a connected RapidPro (or [TextIt](https://textit.in/)) flow. This integration works with the Ona-hosted version of RapidPro [(rapidpro.ona.io)](http://rapidpro.ona.io/) and other versions of RapidPro and TextIt. You can read more about RapidPro on the [RapidPro's community website](https://community.rapidpro.io/).

This integration is a powerful tool you can use to do any of the following: 

1. Transmit incoming data from your Ona account to RapidPro or TextIt to trigger SMS or email alerts;
2. Register people automatically in RapidPro or TextIt for SMS follow up; 
3. Use SMS or IVR as a supplemental way to capture data in addition to digital forms in your Ona account; and
4. Create other useful notifications.

##### <a name="getting-started"></a>Getting Started

To get started using RapidPro, create an Ona-hosted RapidPro account at [rapidpro.ona.io](https://rapidpro.ona.io) by entering your email address, then clicking on the **Create Account** button. Fill in information about yourself, then choose a name for your organization and select your timezone. 

>##### Account Credits<br/> 
Each new RapidPro account is automatically given **1,000 free credits** to get started with. Email [sales@ona.io](mailto:sales@ona.io) for more information on purchasing additional credits for your Ona RapidPro account. Accounts with **100,000 credits or more have** the ability to add additional users to the organization account with various permission levels. 

##### <a name="creating-flows"></a>Creating Flows

Once you have created an account, you can begin creating flows in the flows tab. Your flows define the SMS or IVR interactions and follow-up actions with your contacts. Please visit the [RapidPro documentation site](http://docs.rapidpro.io/) for more information on creating flows.

##### <a name="adding-channel"></a>Adding a Channel

A channel is a phone number which Rapidpro can use to send and receive messages on your behalf. With your account set up, you can add channels by installing the Rapidpro application on an Android device. 
To connect your sim card to the Rapidpro Ona hosted version, you will be required to change the IP address to rapidpro.ona.io under the Rapidpro app settings. 

* Tap on the app menu bar several times to launch **Advanced Settings** until the popup Advanced Settings appears on the screen.

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/rapidpro-07.png)

* Press the **Menu button** then scroll down to **Advanced Settings**

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/rapidpro-08.png)

* Tap on IP Address then change the address to rapidpro.ona.io. 

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/rapidpro-09.png)

Once done, you will receive a new claim code which you will in turn use to add your phone number to channels. Please refer to this [documentation](http://docs.rapidpro.io/#article_687096) for more information on how to add channels.

##### <a name="passing-form-submissions"></a>Passing Form Submissions to a Flow

To push form submissions from Ona to a Rapidpro flow, you will be required to connect your form to your RapidPro account by providing the API token for your RapidPro account. You can obtain the API token at [https://rapidpro.ona.io/api/v1](https://rapidpro.ona.io/api/v1) while you are signed in to your RapidPro account.

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/rapidpro-01.png)

##### <a name="connecting-form-rapidpro"></a>Connecting a Form to Rapidpro

To connect a form to RapidPro, go to the **form’s Settings** page on Ona, then click on the **Apps** tab:

Click on the **Add New App** button to view the list of possible app connections.

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/rapidpro-1.png)

From the apps listed, click on the **RapidPro (Ona hosted)** icon if you are connecting Ona to a flow from Ona-hosted RapidPro. Click on the RapidPro option if you are using RapidPro hosted elsewhere.

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/rapidpro-2.png)

Then click on the **Add Connection** button to connect the form to your RapidPro account.

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/rapidpro-3.png)

You will be prompted to enter your **RapidPro (Ona hosted) API Key** that you [obtained earlier](#passing-form-submissions). Once you have entered the API key, click on **Next** to proceed.

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/rapidpro-4.png)

Select the RapidPro flow from the dropdown that you want to connect your form to, then click **Save**. Incoming submission data will be sent to this flow.

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/rapidpro-5.png)

Once you’re all done, the RapidPro connection will appear under the **Connections** section on the page. 

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/rapidpro-6.png)

To make edits, click the **Edit** button on the right side of the connection. This will redirect you to the **Edit Connections** page where you can edit the connection settings.

![](/content/screenshots/onaapps/rapidpro-7.png)

>**Important points to consider:**<br/>  
You can use the function ```@extra.{field-name}``` in your flows to reference data from the form submission.
<br><br>
For fields in groups, use the function ```@extra.{group-name}_{field-name}```. Make sure to use an underscore as the separator between the group and field name.
<br><br>
Deleting a connection stops new submissions from going to your flow but does not delete your flow. 
<br><br>
Rapidpro flows are triggered by new form submissions only and not edits to existing submissions.

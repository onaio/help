Ona has been rebuilt from the ground up with new code and a new look — it has all of the previous functionality for data collection plus features to help you better manage data and share information with collaborators. We're looking for amazing feedback from you, our users, to help us build what you need.

What's changed?

* **Projects.** A project is a set of related forms that are grouped together and have the same sharing permissions.
* **New User Interface.** We rebuilt our interface to be cleaner, faster and to reflect updates to functionality.
* **[Improved Sharing Permissions.](http://help.ona.io/faq/what-are-the-share-settings/)** Projects can be shared with other Ona users in a way similar to other popular tools and apps on the web.
* **Improved Security.** Assign every user in your system (including data gatherers) their own username and password. You can now require data collectors to login without giving them access to your project’s private data.
* **Data Visualization.** We made it easier to switch between map and table views and added Summary Charts that let you review summary statistics. On the map, we added support for multi-select and number ranges.
* **Recent Updates**
	* **Organizations.** Organizations are meant to make it easier to securely share data between it's members and share data with projects. Please email [info@ona.io](mailto:info@ona.io) if interested.
	* **Collaborate.** Easily share data with members of other organizations. Ona is built to represent the way you work.
	* **Realtime XLS Reports.** We are starting to build custom Excel dashboards and reports for our users. These dynamic files are automatically updated with predefined calculations and charts using the latest data, letting you track metrics and indicators in real-time.

Accessing the beta site:

If you have an existing account on Ona, you can login to [https://beta.ona.io](https://beta.ona.io) using the same credentials. All of your existing forms will be collected in a single Project called [username]’s Project. Caution: all data in beta is live and changes are saved.
You can also use our test account with pre-existing projects for you to explore. The credentials are: username: betatester password: demo

Sound exciting? To get started we request you start using the beta site for all of your data needs, i.e., use [beta.ona.io](https://beta.ona.io) like you would [ona.io](https://www.ona.io) on a regular basis. You can always return to using [ona.io](https://www.ona.io) at any time — the underlying data is the same no matter which site you use.

Please send all feedback, problems, or suggestions to [beta@ona.io](mailto:beta@ona.io).

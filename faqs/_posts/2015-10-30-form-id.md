Form ID refers to the unique ID string that helps users to identify a form in Ona.  Users can specify their form’s ID string in the **Settings** sheet of their XLSForm.  See [xlsform.org](http://xlsform.org/#settings) for more information on how to do this.  If no ID string is specified in the form’s **Settings** sheet, the form title is used, and if no form title is specified, the XLSForm file name is used instead.

In ODK Collect, the form ID is shown underneath the form title in the [Get Blank Form](http://help.ona.io/guides/data-collection/#downloading-forms) page:

### Duplicate form IDs not allowed in Ona

No two forms in a user’s account can have the same form ID.  If a user tries to upload two forms with the same form ID in a single project, Ona will reject the second form upload with the following message:

If a user tries to upload two forms with the same form ID in separate projects in the same account, Ona will allow the second form to be uploaded, but Ona will append the second form’s ID string with **_1** to maintain unique ID strings for all forms in the account.  When [replacing the second form](http://help.ona.io/faq/replacing-forms-without-submissions/), be sure to update the form’s ID string or download the XLSForm from the form **Settings** tab in Ona, or else Ona will reject the form upload due to mismatching ID strings.

Ona lets you grant view/edit/submit project access to collaborators. Collaborators must have Ona accounts.

###Select whether your project is public or private

You can keep your project private if you don’t want anyone on the web to see your project or its data. 

To choose who can see your file or folder:

1. Sign in to Ona.
2. Open a project.
3. Click the Share button in the grey bar below the blue header area. If you don’t see the Share button, you don’t have permission to change the share settings.
4. At the top of the Share settings modal, select either public or private:
    | **Project type** | **Definition**                                                                | **Sign-in to Ona account required?** |
    |--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
    | Private      | Only you and collaborators you choose can access the project.             | Yes                              |
    | Public       | The project is accessible by anyone and is visible on your Ona user page. | No                               |

5. If you selected a public project, a “Public - anyone” collaborator group will appear in the list below. Anyone on the web will be able to view your project and project data.
6. Click Done.

###Select the access level for individual collaborators

When you add a collaborator to your project, you can select their level of access for viewing, submitting and editing data to projects. The permission levels breakdown as follows:




Individual accounts have only one admin — the account the project lives on, which for new projects is the creator of the project. To have multiple admins on a single project, create an organization project.

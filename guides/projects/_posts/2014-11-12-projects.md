### Get started on a project

A **project** is the most basic element of Ona. The project contains all of the forms and data related to the project and information to aid understanding for new collaborators on the project, such as **Project description**, **Category** and **Location**. 

Projects are where you set [permissions](#permission-levels) for sharing and form submissions. 

##### <a name="project-vs-form"></a>Project vs. Form

Projects allow you to put related forms together. A **form** is the set of questions into which the user is able to submit data. Forms are the starting point of collecting and viewing information from users. With Ona, you can author forms using the [XLSForm](http://xlsform.org/) syntax with different features such as skip logic and checks.

Data share settings and form submission settings both occur at the Project level. Every form and all of the data in the project inherits the same settings as the project. Therefore, related forms should go into a single project for easy access and collaboration. 

##### <a name="create-a-project"></a>Create a project

Create a **New Project**, that will contain all of the forms and data related to the project. To create a new project:

1. From the **Home** page, click on the **New Project** orange button, located on the right side of your projects page;
<br><br>

1. The **Create Project** modal will pop up as shown in the in the image below;
<br><br>
![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-2.png)
1.Enter the name of the project, in the **Project Name** text box;
<br><br>
![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-3.png)
1. **Select a category** from the project category dropdown e.g. Health;
<br><br>
![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-4.png)
1. Click on **Create Project** button;
<br><br>
![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-5.png)
1. Then, choose the project’s **Share options**;
* First determine whether your project is **Private** or **Public**. Click on **Public** to make the project accessible and findable by anyone who visits the website. Any one who access to a **Public** project will have **Can View** permission level to all forms and data within the project.
![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-6.png)
 * Select **Private**, to make the project private. A **Private** project can only be viewed or contributed by you (the owner) and collaborators with access;
![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-7.png)
* Enter a collaborator's **username** or **name** that you would like to share the project with;
![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-8.png)
* Select the **permission level** from the permissions dropdown. Read more on permissions levels [here](#permission-level).
![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-9.png)
* Then, click on the **Share** button;
![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-10.png)
* The user's name, username and permission level will be displayed on the list of **Collaborators**. Finally, click on the **Done** button when all collaborators have been added to the project.

##### <a name="categories"></a>Categories

These are group labels you add to project to help others identify the project and find the project if it is public.  You can add the project category when creating a project on the **Create Project** modal as explained in the [previous section](#create-a-project).

You can also change the project category from the **Project Settings** page:

### Managing projects

##### <a name="projects-shared-with-you"></a>Projects shared with you

When you login, into your account all the Projects shared with you are accessible on your **Home** page. A project that is shared with you will have the Owner's avatar tagged to it instead of your own as illustrated in the screen shot below:

![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-13.png)

##### <a name="starring"></a>Starring

If there is a current project you are working on or there’s a project you’d like to follow, you can star a project. To **Star** a project click on the **star** icon next to the project name;

![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-15.png)

Once you **Star** a project, it will show up in the **Favourites** tab as shown in the image below:

![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-16.png)

##### <a name="finding-sorting"></a>Finding/Sorting

You can sort projects according to your preference on your home page. Projects can be sorted by **Date Created**, **[Category](#categories)**, **Last Submission** and **Project Name**:

![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-17.png)

Click on **Show** dropdown to view **All**, **Private** or **Public** projects on your shared with you;

![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-18.png)

You can also **Find a project** shared with you from the **Projects** dropdown in the top bar;

![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-14.png)

##### <a name="transfering-projects"></a>Transfering Projects

This means transferring a project from one account to another user’s account or to an organization account. When you transfer a project, the project and all of its forms and data will transfer to the new account and the original user account will lose ownership of the project.  A user can only transfer a project out of an account if they are the project’s admin, and a user can only transfer a project into an organization account if they are an admin in the organization.

To transfer a project:

1. From your home page, click on the **Project Settings** icon;
<br><br>
![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-19.png)
1. On the **Project Settings** page, scroll down to the **Transfer Ownership** section and click on the click on the **Transfer** button;
<br><br>
![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-20.png)
1. A **Transfer Project** modal will pop up:
 * Enter the name of the project to confirm the transfer;
 <br><br>
 ![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-21.png)
 <br><br>
 * Type the **New owner's Ona username** (e.g., another Ona user’s username or the organization’s username) in the text box;
 <br><br>
  ![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-22.png)
 * Finally, click on the **Transfer this project** button to complete the transfer;
 ![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-23.png)

##### <a name="deleting-projects"></a>Deleting projects

You can delete a project from your account. Deleting a project completely removes all the forms and submissions associated with the project. This action is final and your project will be irrecoverable.

To delete a project:

1. From the **Project Settings** page, scroll down to the **Delete Project** section and click on **Delete This Project** button;
<br><br>
![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-24.png)
1. **Confirm Delete** modal will pop up, enter the **Project name** to confirm deletion;
<br><br>
![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-25.png)

1. Then, click on **Delete** button to permanently delete the project and all of the forms and submissions associated with it.
<br><br>

### Collaborating with others

##### <a name="sharing-projects"></a>Sharing projects

Data share settings and form submission settings both occur at the project level and are inherited by all forms in the project. 


To share your project with collaborators:

1. From the **Home** page, click on the **Share Project** icon;
<br><br>
![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-27.png)
You can also access **Share** modal from the project page. If you don’t see the Share button, you don’t have permission to change the share settings.
<br><br>
![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-28.png)
1. You can then **Enter a collaborator's **username** or **name** that you would like to share the project with. 
<br><br>
![](/content/screenshots/projects/projects-8.png)


###### <a name="permission-levels"></a>Permission levels

You can grant project access to collaborators who have Ona accounts. When you add a collaborator to your project, you can select their level of access for viewing, submitting and editing data to projects. If someone is given permission to a project where they have view permissions, they also receive view permissions for the forms. If a user receives **Can Edit** and above permissions for a project, they will be able to submit data to forms, as long as the form status is active. The permission levels breakdown as follows:

<table style="border: 1px solid #E6E6E6;">
  	<thead>
	  <tr>
	      <th></th>
	      <th>Can view</th>

**Note:**<br/> Individual accounts have only one admin — the account the project lives on, which for new projects is the creator of the project. To have multiple admins on a single project, create an [organization project](http://help.ona.io/faq/how-do-i-use-organizations/).

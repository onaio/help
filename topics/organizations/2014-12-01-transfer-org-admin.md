To make someone else the owner of an organization account, you need to make sure there's at least one additional org admin and make sure Ona has updated billing information.

1. If you are the only admin of an organization, you won't be able to leave the organization until there is another admin member. Add a member and change that user's role to Admin.

2. Email the other admin user(s) to check if they have access to admin settings for the organization.

3. If you are the main contact with Ona and handle billing, email <a href="mailto:support@ona.io">Ona Support</a> to make sure they have the contact's information so billing and service is uninterrupted.

### Creating an Organization

##### <a name="what-is-an-organization"></a>What is an organization?

An **organization** account on Ona allows you to better organize and manage your group-owned projects and data.  Org accounts have advanced permission levels over individual accounts.  This means an org admin can add other members to the organization and share admin privileges with them, or they still have the option of maintaining access privileges at the project level, by assigning individual collaborators to one project at a time.  

Org accounts are a great option for international organizations that implement projects in multiple countries or regions or for companies that simply require better data management and access controls for members on their team.  A user can even manage multiple organizations from a single Ona account, obviating the need from before of having to maintain and log in and out of separate accounts for each project.

#### <a name="add-organization-members"></a>How to add organization members

Organization members are other Ona users who have been added to the organization by the org admin and can have access to all projects within the org account.

Members of an organization are added by admins in one of three roles. A member is added and assigned on the member list page using the Ona username.

Note: Members of an organization must sign up for an account with Ona. Read more on account [signing up](http://help.ona.io/guides/getting-started/#signing-up).

To add members to your organization:

1. On the top bar, select the organization from the **Organizations** drop-down list;
<br><br>
![](/content/screenshots/organizations/org1.png)
1.  From the organization’s page, click on the **Manage Members** link on the left side of the page;
<br><br>
![](/content/screenshots/organizations/org2.png)
1. To add a member, enter the member’s username in the top left box and click the **Add Member** button. Once added, the users will appear in the **Members** list below. If you do not see a text box to add members, you do not have permissions to add members.
<br><br>
![](/content/screenshots/organizations/org-3.png)
1. The member you’ve added to the organization will automatically have the **Member** role. Click on the dropdown menu next to the member to change the members role as shown in screen shot below. All the organization members roles and their permissions in the organization have been explained in the [Organization members roles section](#org-member-roles).
<br><br>

#### <a name="organization-member-roles"></a>Organization members roles

The three organization member roles are **Admin**, **Project Manager** and **Member**. By default, the user who sets up the organization is granted **Admin** role. 

 > 
**Note**<br/>An organization can have more than one admin.


The following table shows the 3 organization member roles and what permissions each role has:

<br><br>
![](/content/screenshots/organizations/org-8.png)
1. Then, follow the instructions in provided in the [create project guide](http://help.ona.io/guides/projects/#create-a-project). 

##### <a name="org-project-differences"></a>Org project differences

Organization projects are similar to any other projects,(i.e they are created in the same way, can either be public or private). An organization project is different from individual projects in the following ways:

* The project is created and can be found within the organization account;

* An organization project can have multiple admins (the creator and org admins). An org project will only have one admin if it was created by an org admin who is the only org admin.
* The [organization members](#organization-member-roles) (**Members in** [**organization**]) group is added to all [organization projects](#creating-org-projects) (_the members can [permissions](http://help.ona.io/guides/projects/#permission-levels) can be Can View, Can View & Download, Can Submit, Can Edit, can View,  or CANNOT view_). 
* Every new member that is added to organization has same permissions as other members,
* An organization member won’t see all organization projects in their list, even when they’re assigned the Can submit permissions through the **“Members in org”** group. The form will only show up if the user is explicitly added. This means that the member can only submit data will only if the link is shared directly with the user from outside means such as email.
* Organization projects can also be **Public**. If a project is made public, a new group **Anyone** is added to the share list, meaning there are 4 groups right off the bat in public project (i.e creator, organization admins, all members of org, and public anyone).

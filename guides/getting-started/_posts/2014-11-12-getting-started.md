##### Projects

Create a project and upload forms and data related to the project. 

![](/content/screenshots/getting_started_new_project.png)

The project contains all of the forms and data related to the project and information to aid understanding for new collaborators on the project, such as project description, category and location. Projects are where you set permissions for sharing and form submissions. Every form and all of the data in the project inherits the same settings as the project. Therefore, related forms should go into a single project for easy access and collaboration.

##### <a name="sharing-projects"></a>Sharing projects

Set sharing and form submissions permissions for the project. The project can be made **Public** or **Private**, a **Public Project** is accessible to anyone on the internet with the project link while a **Private Project** is only accessible to Ona users to whom the project has been shared with.

A collaborator can have **Can View (Read Only)**, **Can Submit**, and **Can Edit** permissions. Read more on project permissions [here](PERMISSIONS GUIDE).

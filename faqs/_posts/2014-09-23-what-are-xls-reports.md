We developed XLS Reports to quickly and easily create dynamic Excel dashboards. For the first time, Ona users can access a beautiful ExcelÂ® report with custom metrics and indicators, updated with the latest data from their forms.

Realtime XLS Reports are currently available as a made-to-order solution. We work with clients to design and develop reports that are tailored to their specific needs. The technology is as flexible as Microsoft Excel and has been used for minimum viable product dashboards, rapid prototyping and finished reports. If this sounds like it'd be useful to you, send us an email with the following info:

* Company/Organization name. 
* Description or example of the report you need.
* Description or CSV sample of the data you are starting from.
* How many times do you plan on accessing the report per month?

You can learn more by visitng the [RealTime XLS Reports page](http://company.ona.io/reports/) or downloading the [RealTime XLS Report info sheet](http://company.ona.io/reports/Ona-RealTime-XLS-Report.pdf).

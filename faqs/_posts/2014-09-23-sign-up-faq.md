####What is Ona?
Ona is a simple and powerful data platform. We help organizations collect, share and make sense of data from the field. Ona is built on Open Data Kit, an open-source set of mobile data collection tools.

**Why would I want to use Ona?**

Ona is constantly improving [link to release list page] to help you get the most accurate data for your program and translate that data into actionable information. Ona also offers Google Drive-like sharing permissions, allowing you to give only people you specify access to the data.

**Is Ona right for me?**

Probably. Whether you are new to digital data or have been collecting and analyzing data digitally for a decade, Ona is quick to pick up, but it includes advanced features that are useful in complex projects and surveys.

**What’s required to use Ona?**

Since Ona is a web-based, so you can use it from any computer or smartphone. You’ll need an internet connection for setting up projects and deploying forms to mobile devices, but a data connection is not required for collecting data. We recommend Google Chrome [link] as your browser, though the website will work in any browser. To use ODK Collect, you’ll need a device running Android.

**Can Ona be used offline with no data connection?**

Yes. You only need a data connection to transfer forms to the mobile device. Once there, data is collected and stored on the device until a data connection is available or, if the data was collected using ODK Collect, until the device is connected to the computer and data is transferred using ODK Briefcase.

**Can anyone access my forms and data?**

Only those you choose can access your projects, forms and datasets. You can easily see who has access to your files in the project share settings.


**I have data from another service. Can I transfer the data to my Ona account?**

Yes, you can migrate your data to Ona’s servers by using a tool called ODK Briefcase [provide link to glossary?], which lets you transfer data across ODK Aggregate servers. For ODK Briefcase to work on your computer, make sure Java 6 or higher is installed. A detailed explanation on how to transfer data to your account can be found [here](http://help.ona.io/faq/odk-briefcase/).


**Who’s behind Ona?**

Ona’s founding team met while at Columbia University, where we built tools that improved the delivery of vital services and developed and implemented technological solutions for Earth Institute projects in India and Africa. Our team consists of a core group in Nairobi, Kenya and a satellite office in New York. Read more about it in our story, [Starting Ona](http://blog.ona.io/general/2014/05/21/starting-ona.html).

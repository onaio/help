##### <a name="requirements"></a>Requirements

There are three requirements necessary for creating your first project in Ona:

* Ona account
* Excel or any spreadsheet software that can produce .xls or .xlsx files 
* Android smartphone or any device that can open a web browser

Ona is a web-based data management platform; you can use Ona from any computer or smart device with an internet connection.  To start using Ona, you first need to create an Ona account. You can sign up for an account [here](https://beta.ona.io).  

Ona offers a variety of account options, both free and paying.  The account you choose is based on the amount of functionality you require for your project(s).  Visit the [pricing page link] for more information on account options and pricing.      

Once your account is set up, you can start uploading your forms that you author in Excel or any other spreadsheet software that can produce .xls or .xlsx files.  Ona automatically converts these files into the format required for mobile and web based data collection. 

After your forms are uploaded to your Ona account, you can start collecting data a variety of ways: 

1. via an **Android smartphone** using a free mobile application called Open Data Kit (ODK) Collect; or 
2. via a **computer** or any **smart device** that can open the form’s web url.

Ona supports IE, Safari, Google Chrome, and Mozilla web browsers for data collection; however, we strongly recommend using Google Chrome for form submissions if possible, as Chrome supports the most features and provides the best performance.

### Account Setup

##### <a name="registration"></a>Registering for an Account

Ona is a web-based, that works on any modern web browser. To sign up for an Ona account please follow the instructions explained in the [Signing up](/guides/getting-started/#signing-up) guide.

##### <a name="logging-in"></a>Logging in

Enter your account **username** or email address and **password** to [login](https://beta.ona.io/login) into your Ona account. If you forgotten your account's password read more on [how to reset your account password](/faq/forgot-password). 
 

##### <a name="edit-profile"></a>Editing your profile

Your public profile page on Ona is the profile that other web users can see if they search for you on Ona.  It contains your name, username, avatar, and a list of your public projects (don’t worry, your [Private Project](http://help.ona.io/faq/what-are-the-share-settings/) remain hidden and private!.) 

To view your profile, click on the drop down menu next to your profile avatar in the top right corner of your account, then click on your name.

Your profile page will look something like this:

> 
**Note:**<br/> If you are logged in, you will be able to see all of your projects in your profile page, both public and private.  To see what your public profile page looks like to other web users, copy the website url from your project page, log out of Ona, then paste the website url back into the web address bar.  You should now only see your publicly shared information, including any public projects in your account.

You can update the information that’s in your profile page by going to the **Settings** menu.  Click on the drop down menu next to your profile avatar in the top right corner of your account, then click on **Settings**.

On the **Edit Public Profile** tab, you can add or change your profile information and upload a picture to replace your avatar.  Make sure you add information on where you work and your website address or twitter handle, so that other Ona users can follow your work!

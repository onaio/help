### Account Setup

##### <a name="registration"></a>Creating an account

Ona is a web-based platform that works on any modern web browser. To sign up for an account follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](/guides/getting-started/#signing-up) guide or visit <a href="https://ona.io/join" target="_blank">https://ona.io/join</a> to get started quickly.

##### <a name="logging-in"></a>Logging in

Enter your username or email address and password to [log in](https://ona.io/login) to your Ona account. If you have forgotten your password, you can [reset your account password](/faq/forgot-password). 
 
##### <a name="edit-profile"></a>Editing your profile

Your public profile page on Ona is the profile that other web users can see if they search for you on Ona. It contains your name, username, avatar, and a list of your public projects (don’t worry, your [private projects](https://help.ona.io/faq/public-vs-private-project) remain hidden and private). 

To view your profile, click on the drop-down menu next to your profile avatar in the top right corner of your account, then click on your name.

![](/content/screenshots/users-accounts/account-profile1.png)

Your profile page will look something like this:

![](/content/screenshots/users-accounts/account-profile2.png)

> 
**Note:**<br/> If you are logged in, you will be able to see all of your projects in your profile page, both public and private. To see what your profile page looks like to other web users, copy the website url from your profile page, log out of Ona, then paste the website url back into the web address bar. You should now only see your public projects.

You can update the information that is in your profile page by going to the **Settings** menu option in the account drop-down menu.

![](/content/screenshots/users-accounts/account-profile3.png)

On the **Edit Public Profile** tab, you can add or change your profile information and upload a picture to replace your avatar.

![](/content/screenshots/users-accounts/account-profile4.png)

After you make the desired changes to your profile information, click on the **Save Changes** button at the bottom.

##### <a name="organization"></a>Creating an organization account

After creating your Ona account, you can optionally create an organization account. An organization account is different from a personal account in that it can be managed by multiple users, making it ideal for organizations that need to manage data across different teams. You can read more about this type of account in the [Organizations Guide](https://help.ona.io/guides/organizations/) and how org accounts differ from personal accounts in the [faq](https://help.ona.io/faq/org-accounts-vs-personal-accounts).

### Account Management

#### <a name="how-to-change-your-email-address"></a>How do I change the email address on my account?

It’s important to keep your email address up to date on your Ona account, as this is the primary way we communicate updates about the Ona platform with our users. If you forget your account password, you will need to access the email address listed on your account to [reset your password](/faq/forgot-password).

1. To change your account email address, navigate to your **Settings** page and click on the **Edit Account Settings** tab;
1. Scroll down to the **Change Email Address** section and type the new email address then enter your password;

### Upgrading Your Account

##### <a name="free-plan"></a>What are the limits of the free plan?

When you create an account on Ona, the account is automatically placed on the free plan. The limits of the free plan for personal accounts are below. 

-	1 private project
-	Up to 10 private forms
-	Up to 500 private form submissions per calendar month

All public projects, public forms, and public data are free and unlimited on Ona.

[Organization accounts](https://help.ona.io/guides/organizations/) on the free plan can have unlimited public projects, public forms, and public data only and up to 3 organization members. Upgrade the organization account to make your data private.

With both personal and organization accounts on the free plan, users can email the [public community forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ona-community) for support. Upgrade your account for direct email support with our Nairobi-based support team.

##### <a name="over-limit"></a>What happens if I try to go over the free plan limits?

If your account is already on the free plan, you will be prevented from exceeding the free plan limits. For personal accounts, this means you will not be able to create more than 1 private project in your account, and you will not be able to upload more than 10 private forms. Private form submissions that exceed 500 for the calendar month will be blocked from being sent to the server. If this happens, your form submissions will be safely stored on the device (if using ODK Collect) or in the web browser (if using Enketo). You can upgrade your account to be able to send the submissions, or you can wait until the beginning of the next month, when the submission count resets to zero.

For organization accounts, you will be restricted to creating public projects if on the free plan.

##### <a name="downgrade-over-limit"></a>What happens when I downgrade my account and it’s over the free plan limits?

If you go over the free plan limits when your account is upgraded, and you subsequently downgrade your account, then your account will be over the free plan limits. If this happens, certain restrictions will be placed on your account, including:

- No new private projects can be created
- No new forms can be uploaded to private projects
- No adding project collaborators
- No replacing forms or making forms inactive
- No viewing Enketo webforms
- No new form submissions from ODK Collect and Enketo webforms
- No data visualization. The Map, Table and Charts views are disabled
- Only project administrators can download the form’s raw data

In addition, if you downgrade your account from a plan that includes access to advanced features to an account that doesn’t include access to advanced features, users will no longer be able to view or access the advanced features in the account.

To unlock your account, you will need to either upgrade the account to a higher plan that fits your account usage level, or you can try to consolidate projects and forms to get under the free plan limits. There are a couple of ways you can consolidate projects and forms to get under the free plan limits:

- Make your private projects public. This will reduce the number of private projects in your account and will also make the forms and data in the project public and accessible to anyone on the internet. You can do this in the project share settings window.
- Delete your private projects or forms. Deleting a project can be done on the project settings page, and forms can be deleted in the form drop-down menu. 

##### <a name="upgrade"></a>How do I upgrade my account?

Upgrading your Ona account is easy. Visit our [plans](https://ona.io/plans.html) page and fill out the short upgrade form to get started. We’ll respond to your request shortly (our office hours are 9am – 6pm Nairobi (EAT) time) and work with you to identify a pricing plan that best fits your data collection needs. 

##### <a name="choosing-account"></a>Choosing which account to upgrade

Any account in Ona can be upgraded, including both personal and organization accounts. If you have more than one account on Ona, the account that should be upgraded is the account that hosts your projects, forms, and data. 

This means that you should create new projects and forms and submit data to the Ona account that is upgraded, because the expanded account limits are applied to the account that is upgraded and not to the individual collaborator accounts that are added to projects.

To make sure you are creating projects in the account that is upgraded, select the upgraded account name in the dropdown when creating a new project. See the screenshot below. All accounts that you have permission to create a new project in are listed in the dropdown.

<br><br>
![](/content/screenshots/users-accounts/project-owner-dropdown.png)

For existing projects, you can check the account avatar and username shown on the project page, which indicates the account that owns the project.

<br><br>
![](/content/screenshots/users-accounts/project-owner.png)

If you have projects and forms spread across different accounts, and you want to consolidate everything into one account that is upgraded, you can use the [project transfer feature](https://help.ona.io/guides/projects/#transferring-projects) to move projects between accounts, or you can move individual forms between accounts using the **Move to** option in the form drop-down menu.

##### <a name="billing"></a>Billing options

Once you’ve identified an appropriate plan for your Ona account and are ready to pay, there are a number of ways to pay for the account upgrade.

**Subscribe to the monthly plan with a credit or debit card and make automatic payments every month**

This is the fastest and easiest way to sign up. Subscribe online with a credit or debit card, and your account will be automatically billed each month until you decide to cancel. There is no annual commitment, and you can pay as you go. Automated receipts will be sent each month by email.

**Pre-pay for a set number of months with a credit or debit card**

Make a one-time payment online with a credit or debit card for a specified number of months. An automated receipt will be sent by email. Your Ona account will be downgraded at the end of the subscription period, unless you decide to renew your subscription.

**Pre-pay for 6 or 12 months via bank transfer**

For users who can pre-pay in 6 or 12-month segments, invoice and bank transfer is another payment option.

##### <a name="special-plans"></a>Do you offer special pricing for students or non-profits?

We introduced the **Impact Grant Program**, which provides a free account upgrade and support to students and members of grassroots or volunteer organizations who are making a difference in their communities but might have difficulty paying to upgrade their account. To learn more about the program and to see if you qualify, please visit the [program page](https://ona.io/impact-grant.html).

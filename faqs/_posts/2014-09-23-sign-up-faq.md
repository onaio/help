###What is Ona?<a name="whatisona"></a>
Ona is a simple and powerful data platform. We help organizations collect, share and make sense of data from the field. Ona is built on Open Data Kit, an open-source set of mobile data collection tools.

<a name="whyona"></a>

###Why would I want to use Ona?
Ona is constantly improving [link to release list page] to help you get the most accurate data for your program and translate that data into actionable information. Ona also offers Google Drive-like sharing permissions, allowing you to give only people you specify access to the data.

###Is Ona right for me?
Probably. Whether you are new to digital data or have been collecting and analyzing data digitally for a decade, Ona is quick to pick up, but it includes advanced features that are useful in complex projects and surveys.

<a name="requirements"></a>

###What’s required to use Ona?
Since Ona is a web-based, so you can use it from any computer or smartphone. You’ll need an internet connection for setting up projects and deploying forms to mobile devices, but a data connection is not required for collecting data. We recommend Google Chrome [link] as your browser, though the website will work in any browser. To use ODK Collect, you’ll need a device running Android.

<a name="offline"></a>

###Can Ona be used offline with no data connection?
Yes. You only need a data connection to transfer forms to the mobile device. Once there, data is collected and stored on the device until a data connection is available or, if the data was collected using ODK Collect, until the device is connected to the computer and data is transferred using ODK Briefcase.

<a name="permissions"></a>

###Can anyone access my forms and data?
Only those you choose can access your projects, forms and datasets. You can easily see who has access to your files in project sharing. The help page has a [guide to how sharing works](http://help.ona.io/faq/what-are-the-share-settings/).

<a name="cost"></a>

###How much does Ona cost?
We will be introducing pricing when the beta period is over and are still working on the details. However, we plan to always offer a free account level based on usage. Additionally, we are dedicated to providing free service to the many Ona users from grassroots organizations taking part in unfunded projects.

<a name="enterprise"></a>

###Are there enterprise-level accounts?
Yes. Enterprise users can [email us](info@ona.io) to find out about custom features, advanced support options, and enterprise-level data management.

<a name="beta"></a>

###When will beta.ona.io replace ona.io?
We are excited about v2 of Ona, but are still in the process of fixing bugs and making improvements. As such, we have no timeline for replacing ona.io with beta.ona.io, but we will notify all users at least 30 days before the transition.

<a name="transferdata"></a>

###I have data from another service. Can I transfer the data to my Ona account?
Yes, you can migrate your data to Ona’s servers by using a tool called ODK Briefcase [provide link to glossary?], which lets you transfer data across ODK Aggregate servers. For ODK Briefcase to work on your computer, make sure Java 6 or higher is installed. A detailed explanation on how to transfer data to your account can be found [here](http://help.ona.io/faq/odk-briefcase/).

<a name="localdeploy"></a>

###Can I host my own version of Ona i.e. install a local deployment?
Yes, please see [https://github.com/SEL-Columbia/formhub/wiki/Installation-and-Deployment](https://github.com/SEL-Columbia/formhub/wiki/Installation-and-Deployment). In some cases we also work with clients to implement installs. Please email [info@ona.io](mailto:info@ona.io) with an overview of your needs.

<a name="language"></a>

###Is Ona available in other languages?
Yes, forms can be written in multiple languages and one can switch between them in both the ODK Collect Android app and in Enketo web forms. Read more on adding multiple languages to a form on [XLSform.org](http://xlsform.org/#language).

The user interface is available in Kiswahili and German, which you can change in the Account Settings page. Support materials are not yet available in other language. We are happy to take requests on language — just email [support@ona.io](support@ona.io).

An **organization account** is an account that is owned and managed by multiple Ona users.  Ona users can be added to the org as [members](https://help.ona.io/guides/organizations/#add-organization-members), allowing the projects, forms, and data hosted inside the account to be collectively shared and managed.  Users can still be added [separately to a project within the account](https://help.ona.io/guides/projects#sharing-projects) without having to be added as a member to the org.

A **personal account** is owned and managed by a single user.  Projects, forms, and data hosted within a personal account are owned and managed only by the account owner.  The owner can [share their projects](https://help.ona.io/guides/projects#sharing-projects) with other users.  Unlike org accounts, personal accounts do not allow more than one user with admin role to be added to a project.

When users sign up with Ona using [https://ona.io/join](https://ona.io/join), they are creating a personal account.  Users with personal accounts can create org accounts by logging in to their account and selecting the [New Organization](https://ona.io/organizations) option in the account dropdown.  Other users can then be [added to the org as members](https://help.ona.io/guides/organizations/#add-organization-members).  All of the orgs that a user is a member of will be listed in the Organizations dropdown menu.

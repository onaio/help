Private projects and forms may be locked due to downgrading your plan, nonpayment or going over your usage limits. When projects and forms are locked, access to your projects, forms and records is limited:

- No data visualization. The map, table and charts views are disabled.
- Submissions to forms are rejected.
- Can't create new private projects or add forms to private projects
- Can't add or edit project collaborators
- Project collaborators cannot download data

###Unlocking a locked account due to a plan downgrade

If you recently downgraded and have too many private projects or forms for your new plan level, your account will be locked. To unlock your account, you can:
- Upgrade to a plan that matches the number of private projects and forms you have
- Make your private projects public. This will make your forms and data accessible to anyone on the internet.
- Delete your private projects.


###Unlocking a locked account due to a nonpayment

If your account is locked because you haven't paid your bill or renewed your plan, send us an email at billing@ona.io to learn how you can pay your balance. When payment is received, your account will be unlocked.


###Unlocking a locked account due to a going over limits

You are only able to go over your the monthly submission limit on the free Community personal account. To unlock your account, you can email sales@ona.io to upgrade your account. Otherwise, you can wait until the next month when the submissions limit will reset.

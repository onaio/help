Importing data lets you add submissions in bulk or make edits using spreadshoot software. It follows a few basic rules:
- New rows will be added as new records in Ona.
- Changes to existing rows will edit the existing records. Editing records happens when the instanceID or _uuid matches an existing record's instanceID or _uuid, which is the case if the data was originally exported from Ona.
- No deletions are done. Our system cannot detect if a unique row was removed. To delete a record, select a submission on the map or table view and click "Delete".
- Files should be in CSV format.

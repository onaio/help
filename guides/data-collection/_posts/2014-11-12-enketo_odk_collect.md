There are two options that Ona users have for data collection: **[Enketo Smart Paper](https://enketo.org/)** and **[ODK Collect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.odk.collect.android)**.  

Enketo is a web application that works on any modern web browser (although we highly recommend Chrome), while ODK Collect is an Android application that can be installed on any Android smartphone or tablet device.

Enketo and ODK Collect can work in tandem, meaning that a single form can be deployed at the same time with Enketo and ODK Collect; there is no need to author separate forms for each.  This guide walks you through the steps for collecting data in both Enketo and ODK Collect.  Whether you use Enketo or ODK Collect (or both) is primarily based on your data collection and user needs.

##### <a name="collecting-data-offline"></a>Collecting data offline

Both Enketo and ODK Collect work offline, meaning that users can launch forms and collect and save their data without an internet or data connection.

### Using Enketo

##### <a name="introduction-to-enketo"></a>An introduction to Enketo

Enketo is a lightweight web application that is used for data entry in Ona. Enketo forms, also known as webforms, launch in your computer or mobile device's web browser.  Along with ODK Collect, Enketo is a major component of Ona's ecosystem that, together with XLSForm authoring, provides a complete solution for collecting data and sharing information. 

Enketo has the following key features:

* **Offline capable** - Enketo webforms can be filled with data and saved without an Internet connection. Once a webform is  opened online for the first time, a copy of the webform is stored inside the web browser. The user can bookmark the webform, and from then onwards be able to access it with or without an Internet connection. Data that is entered while in offline mode is safely stored in the web browser until the user is able to connect to the Internet and upload the records later on. Users can safely close their web browser or computer without it affecting their saved data.  Your data is deleted from the web browser only after the record is successfully submitted to the server. 

* **Print-friendly forms** - Enketo can automatically generate a print-friendly version of each form for traditional data collection with paper and pen, without the need to maintain a separate paper version of the form.

* **Low technical requirements** - The only requirement to use Enketo is access to a modern web browser. One can deploy Enketo webforms easily and quickly on any laptop, computer or smart mobile device.

##### <a name="opening-webform"></a>Opening an Enketo form

Once you have successfully [added a form](Uploading forms) to your Project on Ona, you can immediately open it in Enketo webforms and start collecting data following the steps below:

From the list of **Forms** in your Project, select the **Webform** icon next to the name of the form you wish to open.

<br><br>

1. The web form will be launched as shown in the screen shot below: 
1. Once the form is loaded, bookmark it for easy offline access;
1. An icon at the top left of the form can be seen as shown in the image below. The icon signifies that the form is succesfully installed in the browser and ready for offline use;
1. Fill out your Web form;
1. Click on the **Submit** button at the bottom of the form when you are done. The records will be automatically stored and queued on your computer until an Internet connection is available. When the application is online, records will be automatically submitted - one by one.

##### <a name="queued-records"></a>Queued records

These are the records that are stored inside your browser (even if you turn off your computer or go offline) until they have been uploaded to the server. 

Queued records can be seen on the form's side bar with a list of records and their upload status. 
 
 To reveal the queued records:
 
 1. Click on the **Records Queued** icon;
 1. A record's border will turn orange when an upload is going;
 1. When an upload succeeds, the border turns green and then the record disappears from the queue;
 1. The record turns red if an error occurs, an error message is briefly shown underneath. The error message can be revealed and hidden at any time by clicking the record.
 
Queued records are uploaded automatically in the background, every 5 minutes when the web page is open and an Internet connection is available. 

To force an upload in between automatic attempts, click **Upload** as shown below:
 

##### <a name="saving-drafts"></a>Saving drafts

You can **Save records as Draft** then continue filling them at a later time. To mark a record as draft:

1. Click on the **Save as Draft** checkbox above the **Submit** button;
1. Then click on **Save Draft** button to save the record;
1. A dialog box will pop-up prompting you to enter the **Record Name** to make it easy to find a draft record later in a long list of records. The name exists locally in the browser storage only and will not be transferred back to the server!
1. Type the record name then click on the **Save&Close** button;

To load the draft record:

1. Click on the **Records Queued** icon;
1. In the sidebar, click on the record that has a little pencil icon;
1. A notification message will pop up to notify you that the draft record has been loaded on your browser;
1. Continue filling out the form, then uncheck the **Save as Draft** checkbox when you are done;
1. Then, finally click on the **Submit** button to upload the record to the server.

**NOTE:**

When a record is saved without marking it as a 'draft', it is considered cleared for uploading as soon as a connection is available. 

### ODK Collect

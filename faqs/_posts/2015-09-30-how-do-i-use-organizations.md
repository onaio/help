Organizations are a way to simplify group-owned datasets, expand on access permissions, and focus data workflow for [organization projects](http://help.ona.io/guides/organizations/#organization-projects).  If you ever had to manage multiple Ona accounts, desired a company-specific project list, or needed central control of project data Organizations are best suited for you. 

### Who are Organization Members?

Organization members are other Ona users who have been added to the organization by an org admin and have access to the projects within an org account. For information on org members please have a look at [this guide](http://help.ona.io/guides/organizations/#add-organization-members).

### Share permissions for organization projects

All projects in Ona have the same [sharing permissions](http://help.ona.io/guides/projects/#permission-levels). There are three differences in the sharing permissions for [organization projects](http://help.ona.io/guides/organizations/#organization-projects):

1. An **all members in the organization** group is added to all organization projects. You can set permission levels for all members in the organization just as you would anybody, with the addition of hiding the project using the *cannot view* permission. 
2. An **all org admins** group is added to projects to make it clear that organization admins have access to the project you created in the organization. 
3. Organization projects can have multiple admins.
